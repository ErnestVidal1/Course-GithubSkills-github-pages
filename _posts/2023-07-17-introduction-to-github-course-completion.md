I have successfully completed the ["Introduction to GitHub"](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course. 

Initially, the interface was a bit challenging as it was new to me, but I was able to grasp the concepts fairly quickly. 

This course taught me how to create a branch, commit a file, open a pull request, and merge a pull request. 

Overall, it was a great introductory experience to GitHub.
